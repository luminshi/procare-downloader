Procare Media Downloader
========================

Bulk-downloads ALL photos and videos from a Procare (Procare Connect) parent
account and timestamps each file with its original capture date.

- Photos: capture date written into EXIF (DateTimeOriginal / DateTimeDigitized).
- Every file: OS modified/created time set to the capture date (so videos, which
  have no EXIF, still sort correctly in Photos / Google Photos / Explorer).
- Files are organized into monthly folders: procare_media/YYYY-MM/

Usage:
    python procare_download.py --email you@example.com
    python procare_download.py --email you@example.com --out "D:/Daycare Photos"
    python procare_download.py --email you@example.com --since 2024-09-01

You will be prompted for your password (it is never printed or saved).

This talks to the same private API the Procare web app uses. It does not use any
official/public API and may break if Procare changes their backend.
